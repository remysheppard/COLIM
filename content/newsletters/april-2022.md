### SHARING THE LOVE OF JESUS WITH SOMALI MUSLIMS

#### Lent 2022 Mission Highlight 

>  Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst. 16 But for that very reason, I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. 1Timothy 1:15-16 

Lent is a great season to reflect, reverberate and share the love of Jesus Christ with others who still do not know Him. The grace of God transformed Paul the persecutor into a preacher, a murderer into a missionary and minister. This same God is drawing some Somali Muslims here in Central Ohio into Himself through the power of the Holy Spirit. 

This Lent I have the joy of sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ with two Somali Muslims. I have been acquainted with these men for some time because they live near the apartment of one of our Somali Christians. On my March 23, 2022 visit to this neighborhood, I came across these men, and we started talking about Jesus.  

These men told me they already know something about Jesus, Issa. However, they have the Quranic account of Issa in a non-salvific fashion.  So, I kindly asked if they have some time to find out more about Jesus. Surprisingly they said, yes. I sensed the Lord is opening the door to share the Gospel with these men. Then I went to a Somali Christian’s apartment nearby and asked if I can show these men Jesus movie at her place. It was not an easy question for the woman. Still, this sister took a risk and allowed us to watch Jesus’ movie in her apartment.   

As we watched the DVD video: The Life of Jesus the Messiah in Somali language, based on the Gospel of Luke, one of these Somali Muslim men grabbed a pen and paper and kept on taking notes. At times, he reacted, “Wow, I have not seen Jesus in this way. He is gentile, and He did nothing wrong. But they killed Him anyway.” That gave us a chance to pause and talk about why Jesus had to die on the cross?   

I and our Somali Christian sister told them Jesus died in our place, for us, to pay for our sins. Both men finished watching the two-hour-long movie about Jesus with curiosity, even saying Ameen, as it concluded with scripture from the book of Revelation 22:12-21. They were willing to meet again, and they show interest to follow Jesus. Thanks be to God!   

> …. at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,and every tongue Phi. 2:10-22

#### Please pray: 

*	That these two men, by the power of the Holy Spirit, will be able to trust, take up their crosses and follow Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.
*	April 1, 2022 marks Ramadan kickoff, the annual 30 days of (Somali) Muslims fasting when they attempt to increase spiritual piety and somehow earn the favor of Allah. Please pray for us to share the Gospel with clarity and for God to open their heart to hear and receive the Gospel of grace.  
*	For the safety of our Somali Christian sister in the unsafe neighborhood. 
*	Transportation: used cars for donation to Somali Christians in need, gas card. 
*	To get apartments in safe areas close to a Lutheran congregation where they can worship safely.
